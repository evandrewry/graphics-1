Programmming Assignment 1

Evan Drewry (ewd2106)


To compile and run:
    
    $ make


I chose to model 2x3 and 1x1 legos and build a few simple models with them.
The program is basically just a visualizer for the models I built. The
things I made are
    - 3x2 lego
    - 1x1 lego
    - pile of legos that can be added to or removed from lego by lego
    - horse/dog thing
    - pinwheel tessellation
    - checkered floor
and are located in the src/legos/models/ directory. I also calculated normals
for all the vertices for shading.

Keys 1-5 toggle the visibility of various elements in the scene

h,j,k,l are bound to camera movements 

-/_ and =/+ are bound to zoom out and zoom in, respectively.

q and Q add and remove legos from the lego pile
